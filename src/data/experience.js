    desc: "I am spearheading the development of a high-throughput computational pipeline to expand the reach of immunotherapy with precise targeting of tumor antigens. I leverage generative deep learning and large-scale structure prediction to create synthetic binders with high specificity and affinity, overcoming the limitations of current discovery methods. After assisting with the development of an institutional cluster computing platform, I am now optimizing protein designs for subsequent experimental testing and integration into synthetic receptors for CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies.",

    desc: "I designed adeno-associated virus vectors to achieve efficient and targeted knock-in of large transgenes into murine T cells to promote synergistic interactions between engineered T cells and the host immune system. Our aim was to use precise genome-editing to enhance CAR T-cell therapy by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Using these vectors, we generated CAR T cells capable of delivering immunomodulatory payloads in tumors. I performed lymphodepletion studies with the goal of evaluating the therapeutic effect of the modified CAR T cells in immunocompetent mouse models.",

    desc: "I developed a high-throughput genome engineering platform to generate and phenotype combinatorial mutant libraries in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This project aimed to understand how yeast navigates complex fitness landscapes during adaptation, particularly following gene loss. By reproducing adaptive evolution experiments through the generation of combinatorial mutants in deletion strains, I analyzed how specific mutations and their sequential acquisition influence fitness and shape compensatory evolutionary trajectories.",

    desc: "I performed whole-genome sequence analysis of nontoxigenic Clostridium botulinum strains to identify biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for bacteriocin production and uncover novel antimicrobial molecules. By experimentally characterizing their antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action, I evaluated the potency of these bacteriocins and their potential as alternatives to conventional antibiotics.",
