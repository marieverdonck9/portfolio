      "In my Master’s thesis, I delve into genetic mutations and their impact on adaptation in  S. cerevisiae . My main goal is to unravel the intricacies of the fitness landscape experienced by strains during the adaptation process. To achieve this, I am developing a specialized pipeline to introduce several mutations in yeast cells. By dissecting the genetic components that drive adaptation, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how organisms evolve in response to changing environments, ultimately contributing valuable insights to the broader field of evolutionary biology.",
